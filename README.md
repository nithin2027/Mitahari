A Food Detection and Classification with nutrition prediction Application

## Problem statement
●	For those trying to lead healthy lifestyles, the prevalence of bad eating habits and the growth in diet-related health problems present substantial hurdles. Accurately measuring and controlling nutritional intake, particularly when it comes to determining the calorie content of various food products, is one of the main challenges encountered in this context.

●	Traditional approaches to tracking nutrition involve manual food logging or standardized nutritional databases, both of which are time-consuming, prone to inaccuracy, and devoid of real-time feedback. These restrictions make it difficult for people to maintain a balanced calorie intake and make wise food decisions.

●	Our goal is to create a food detection, classification, and calorie estimation system utilizing machine learning approaches to solve this issue. This system provides precise food item recognition, categorization, and estimate from photos in an effort to automate and enhance the nutritional tracking process.

## Motivation
Motivation behind developing a Food Detection and Calorie Estimation System lies in the need for a convenient and accurate solution that empowers individuals to make informed decisions about their food consumption. By leveraging machine learning models for food detection and utilizing APIs for calorie estimation, our system aims to simplify the process of tracking nutritional intake and promote healthier eating habits.
The primary objective of our system is to detect and classify food items accurately using machine learning algorithms. By training models on extensive datasets of food images, we can create robust systems capable of identifying different types of food items. This capability provides users with a seamless way to capture and categorize their food choices.
